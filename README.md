## Translations
Thanks to all the volunteers that already contributed!
More translations are still needed as well as spell checking and keeping the current ones up to date.

## Custom servers

This features allows the user to add a custom server like "pad.myserver.com". It doesn't replace the default servers, it adds customization.

The feature is found in the settings menu as "Server list". The New server dialog will promp when the button is pressed. The server name is just an arbitrary name for the user.
The url must be something like "https://examplehost.com". No more and no less info than the protocol and the host.

To try your new server create a new pad and choose it. You can make it the default option in the settings menu.

**Note:** The server hosts the user adds and their subdomains are now considered part of the _whitelist_. This means that http connections to these domains are allowed.

## Opening a URL

The user can now share an URL to the app in order to open it. Keep in mind that the host server must be previously added, otherwise the URL will be considered unsafe.
